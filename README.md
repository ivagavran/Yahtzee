# Yahtzee

## About this project
- This is a simple uni project created to serve as an introductory to OOP in Kotlin and Intelli J IDE.
- It imitates the famous Yahtzee game, more known as Jamb or Yamb.
- I pushed it to my github profile as an **initial project** to help me repeat my git command knowledge and get my github profile started.
